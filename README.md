# PTM (Programmable Tile Machine)
This program is a virtual machine that tries to emulate many aspects of old 8-bit computer systems such as those introduced during the 70's and early 80's.

It works by running a program written in PTML which is a low-level interpreted programming language similar to Assembly languages.
